The domain costs us $12/year to renew from Google. We got our repository hosted for free on GitHub. We got our site hosted $10/month with Netlify. It costs Tommy ~$20/month to run the mail server, but that server is used for a bunch of his projects, not just PrivSec, and we doubt it will be used that much anyways. The point is, this website does not cost much to run, and as such we will not be accepting donation as a project.

The real cost is the time and energy we put into writing, testing, and fact checking the content. Some of our members may want to accept donation, and you can donate to them individually.
