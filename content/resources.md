NAME | NOTES |
| :--- | :--- |
Rob Braxman | Spreads misinformation about general mobile security, open source security, companies, encrypted messengers (Signal in particular), and email providers (ProtonMail in particular) to sell his insecure products.
PrivacyTools.io | [Hostile takeover](https://www.privacyguides.org/about/privacytools/) of the previous incarnation of PrivacyGuides. The website has practically become an affliate/sponsored links farm and recommends insecure/obsolete products, some of which do not even work.
