[Madaidan's Insecurities](https://madaidans-insecurities.github.io/) | Highlighting security issues within popular technologies, debunking misinformation, and providing free security guidance for everyone. <br> Note that all of these guides were last updated March 2022, so some content is outdated.

Still, Madaidan's guides excel at teaching a general attitude for maintaining privacy and security, and the gists of almost every guide have held up well.
[Wonderfall's Lab](https://wonderfall.dev) | Thoughts and research on security, privacy, and pharmacology.
[Wonderfall's Space](https://wonderfall.space/) | Blog posts about privacy and security in French.
