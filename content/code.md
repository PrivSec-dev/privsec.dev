The development effort of PrivSec.dev is a very personal process compared to "traditional" ways of developing a community website. Your recommendations and ideas behind it will be carefully reviewed, often resulting in critique and criticism. Know that this happens because everyone involved wants to see the best possible solution for the overall success of PrivSec.dev. 

If however, anyone feels personally abused, threatened, or otherwise uncomfortable due to this process, that is not acceptable. If so, please contact us at contact@privsec.dev or the individual members, and they will work to resolve the issue to the best of their ability.

As a maintainer or collaborator of PrivSec.dev, please strive to keep things civil and focused on the technical issues involved. We are all humans, and frustration can be high on both sides of the process. Try to keep in mind the immortal words of Bill and Ted: "Be excellent to each other."
