macOS comes equipped with many security features to keep you safe.

## FileVault

By default, your macOS install is encrypted, but it will automatically unlock on boot. Turning on [FileVault](https://support.apple.com/guide/mac-help/protect-data-on-your-mac-with-filevault-mh11785/mac) will require a user password to unlock the volume. It also makes it so that you need to enter a user password to enter recovery mode.
