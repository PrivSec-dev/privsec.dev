Windows 11: Version 22H2
If you are installing Windows 11, please note that the Home version will offer you the least amount of control regarding settings and disabling telemetry and analytics. If possible, you should try to get Pro, Education, or Enterprise editions. However, these frequently cost more than the Home version (which is usually included free when purchasing the device), sometimes several hundred dollars for a single license. As such, this guide is written for the Home version.
